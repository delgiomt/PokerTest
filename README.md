The file hands.txt, contains 1000 random hands dealt to two players.
Each line of the file contains ten cards (space separated). the
first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards. You can
assume that all hands are valid, each player's hand is in no specific order and
in each hand there is a clear winner.
